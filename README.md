## 🔒 Privacy & Security

- **Local Storage Only**: All data is stored locally on your device
- **No External Servers**: No data is sent to external servers
- **No Personal Data**: Only URLs, titles, and scroll positions are stored
- **User Control**: You can delete any saved session at any time

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Sessions not saving automatically:**
- Check that the extension has all required permissions
- Verify the extension is enabled in Chrome settings

**Scroll positions not restoring:**
- Some websites prevent scroll restoration due to security policies
- Single-page applications may override scroll behavior

**Extension not working on certain pages:**
- Chrome extensions cannot access `chrome://` pages or the Chrome Web Store
- Some secure sites may block extension functionality

### Debug Mode
Open Chrome DevTools on the extension popup to see console logs and debug information.

## 🚧 Development

### Quick Start
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/rheedwahn/session-guardian.git
cd session-guardian

# Install development dependencies
npm install

# Run tests
npm test                          # Unit tests
npm run test:integration         # Integration tests  
npm run test:e2e                 # End-to-end tests
