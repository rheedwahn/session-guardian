## Architecture Overview

### Key Components

- **`background.js`**: Service worker for auto-save and session management
- **`popup.js/html`**: User interface for session operations
- **`content.js`**: Scroll tracking and page-level functionality
- **`manifest.json`**: Extension configuration and permissions

### Storage Structure

Sessions are stored in `chrome.storage.local` with this structure:
```javascript
{
  sessionGuardian_sessions: [
    {
      id: "unique_id",
      name: "Session Name", 
      timestamp: 1234567890,
      type: "manual|auto|crash_recovery",
      windows: [...]
    }
  ]
}
```

## Security Considerations

- Only store necessary data (URLs, titles, scroll positions)
- Never store sensitive form data
- Respect user privacy
- Handle permissions properly
- Validate all stored data before restoration

## Performance Guidelines

- Debounce scroll tracking updates
- Limit number of stored sessions
- Use efficient storage operations
- Minimize background script activity
- Handle large numbers of tabs gracefully

## Browser Compatibility

Currently targeting:
- Chrome 88+ (Manifest V3 support)
- Future: Firefox support planned
